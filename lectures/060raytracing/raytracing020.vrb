\begin{itemize}
\item Assume a surface is made up of tiny mirrors.
\item The statistical distribution of these facets will determine the
  reflection in each direction.
\item More sophisticated stochastic models
  such as these give better approximations to some
  surfaces than Phong reflection.
\end{itemize}
