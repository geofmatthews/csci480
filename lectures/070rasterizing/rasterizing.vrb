\frametitle{Interpolating other quantities} 

Note that as we step $x$ from its initial value to its final value, we
also step $y$ from its initial value to its final value.  We could
also step some other value, such as
\begin{itemize}
\item  $z$
\item a greyscale or color value
\item a normal vector
\item texture coordinates
\end{itemize}
or anything else from an initial value to a final value, thus
LERPing all values from one endpoint to the other.
