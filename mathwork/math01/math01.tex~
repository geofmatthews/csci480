\maketitle

Show your work.  Explain, in each case, how you got a particular
numerical result.  You may, of course, use a computer for numeric
computations, but which expressions you used to get each result must
be made clear.  For example, you can't just put down 12, you must put
down $2^2 + 2^2 + 2^2 = 12$.  You can't just put down 4.443, you
must put down $\pi\cdot\sqrt{2} = 4.443$

\begin{enumerate}
\item Let $v=\vect{2,2,1}$ and $w=\vect{1,-2,0}$.  Find the following:
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item $v\cdot w$
  \item $v\times w$
  \item The vector projection of $w$ on $v$.
  \end{enumerate}

\item Orthogonalize each of the following vectors:
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item $v_1 = \vect{\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}, \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}, 0}$
  \item $v_2 = \vect{-1,1,-1}$
  \item $v_3 = \vect{0,-2,-2}$
  \end{enumerate}

\item Find the cosine of the angle between the vectors
  $v=\vect{1,2,3}$ and $w=\vect{3,2,1}$

  \item Let $v = \vect{4,3,-1}$.  Decompose $v$ into the sum of two
    vectors, one of which is parallel to $n=\vect{\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2},
      \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}, 0}$, and the other is perpendicular.

\end{enumerate}
